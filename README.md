### What is it?

A tool for dumping (reading) and flashing (writing) the firmware of a Mac Pro 4,1 / 5,1 and Xserve 3,1, combined with an analyser of the NVRAM content and the firmware validity.
<br>
Also it can dump and analyse firmwares from the most Macs, from around 2006 to 2017.
<br>

It reads and writes to a ch341a USB programmer as well, to work with desoldered flash chips. It detects a connected programmer and installs the libs to communicate with it. 
  
I added some tools around the Mac administration, that I wrote and find useful. Check out the other .md files for them.

### ==> I needed to encrypt the disk image, as Gatekeeper flaggs it for containing Flashrom. <==  
### *The password is **rom**.*

If you encounter an error, regarding an unknown developer, when attempting to open the Dumper, macOS displays a message stating:  
```macOS cannot verify the developer of``` 
  
To allow the system to open the Dumper, perform a Ctrl-click on it and select open. 

<br>

### If you receive a message indicating that either the apps or the disk image (.dmg) is damaged:

These issues arise from the presence of Flashrom in the package, which is flagged as potentially harmful by Mac Os' Gatekeeper and some malware scanners.  

  
If this dialog persists, you can resolve it using Terminal with the following command:  
```
xattr -cr "/path/to/RomDump Macschrauber.app"
xattr -cr "/path/to/appname.app"
```


<br>

Alternatively, you can:

Execute the scripts in the folder "is damaged fix"
They also can be flagged, if, do ```xattr -cr "/path/to/the.app"```

<br>

Use my Github Downloader, to obtain a copy with no quarantine flag set:
<br>
[https://github.com/Macschrauber/Macschrauber-s-Rom-Dump/releases/download/Release/Download.the.Dumper.from.github.zip](https://github.com/Macschrauber/Macschrauber-s-Rom-Dump/releases/download/Release/Download.the.Dumper.from.github.zip)
<br>
You may need to right-click on the App and select open.
<br><br>
Or, if you want to use an older version, use the downloader button `I have the .DMG file`. This unflags the .DMG by copying it to the user's Download folder and let the downloader remove the quarantine flags.

### Yes, you can indeed disable parts of SIP while leaving others enabled.

If you run csrutil status, even while booted normally, you will see the component parts of it. Each of these can be selectively disabled by running one of the following commands while booted into Recovery mode:

+	csrutil enable --no-internal
+	csrutil enable --without kext 
+	csrutil enable --without fs
+	csrutil enable --without debug
+	csrutil enable --without dtrace
+	csrutil enable --without nvram

You can disable two or more components by structuring the command as follows:
csrutil enable --without kext  --without nvram


for running RomDump Macschrauber csrutil enable --without kext is enough

### If you require assistance with a damaged boot rom, feel free to contact me in English or German at ```macschrauber@gmx.de```
### Also I can upgrade Mac Pro 4,1 (2009) firmwares properly to Mac Pro 5,1 (2010-2012).
### As well as upgrading the firmware of Xserve 3,1 to Mac Pro 5,1 with keeping the Xserve board and system serials
(The Netkas tool or the underlying processes don't work anymore.)

If you want to communicate at Github the preferred language is English.
